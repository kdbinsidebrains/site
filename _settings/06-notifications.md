By default, the plugin shows some notifications, for example:

- when connection state changes
- when something is wrong with credentials

There is no separate configuration per language, but you can find all notifications by **Kdb.** prefix:

![notifications](/assets/images/settings/notifications/notifications.png)

Another way to change settings in the notification itself:

![notificationsBallon](/assets/images/settings/notifications/notificationsBallon.png)

You can change style of the notification, or you can disable some of them.

The IDEA has amazing [code style](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/code-style.html) functionality that allows
auto-code formatting.

The plugin provides the same functionality and default configuration for Q language.

Just go to _File -> Settings -> Editor -> Code Style -> KDB+ Q_:

Please go through the settings yourself as it's better if you just try to change them. You don't have to apply and try
each time as the IDEA provides ability to see result _online_.

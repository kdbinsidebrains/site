## Overview

We are working hard to create a series of training courses to help our users use the KdbInsideBrains plugin and
JetBrains IDEA more
productively in their daily work.

These trainings are intended both for developers creating Q code and for data users, such as traders or analysts.

All these training doesn't cover developing on KDB/Q language but how to effectively use the development environment to
work with the code, tables, charting, and other plugin functionality.

## Location

We provide all trainings online worldwide, or we also can do on-site trainings for any companies located in London.

## Covering topics

We have a set of sections that we can include in the training and for whom these sections are most appropriate.

The full training is designed for 5 hours, including a 30-minute QA part and can be done as one full-day session or
series of short sessions.

When you work with very complex code it could be quite hard to look up required function in a file or navigate thought
code in a file.

The _Structure_ tool window is located in the bottom left corner and must be activated to show a file structure:

![structureToolWindow](/assets/images/features/structure/structureToolWindow.png).

IDEA provides amazing functionality to show a file content that is also supported by the plugin:

![structureOverview](/assets/images/features/structure/structureOverview.png)

Please try all options yourself as there are many ways to set up structure view.
